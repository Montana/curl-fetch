# curl-fetch
A repository for comedy. A recursive bash script that fetches `curl` using `wget` which is another UNIX tool to fetch outside binaries and other things.

## What is `curl-fetch` 
It's simple, it's a bash script that fetches curl, using wget. It can't get anymore recursive than this. Code can be funny too!

## Usage

Open up a terminal and run:

chmod +x ./curl_fetch.sh
./curl_fetc.sh
```
